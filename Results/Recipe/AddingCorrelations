Hi Kabir,

  Instead of just fitting the asymmetry from the ROOT error bars (which do not take into account correlations), try a weighted average according to the weights listed under "weight_i" in my simulation results: https://n3he.wikispaces.com/file/view/sim_2015-03-12/543921200/sim_2015-03-12
That includes proper covariant weighting (albeit with the wrong rates in each cell).  At least it's a start.

  Summary:   A = \frac{\sum_i w_i A_i}{\sum_i w_i}      dA^2 = \frac{1}{\sum_ij  Cov(A_i,A_j)^-1 }

  Note in the above formulas, that A_i  =  raw asymmetry / geometry factor, what I call A'_i in my tech note.  I'm not worrying about polarization yet.  If you do not yet have all of the Covariances, you can estimate the the second formula by calculating  \sum_i (Var(A_i))^-1 ,  and then dividing by the correction ratio (diagonal to full matrix) from MC:   2.547.   Note this is a lot larger than my previous calculation (at 1 atm), because lower pressure gives a LOT more correlation in the wires!

  Ideally if you have extracted the covariances from the data you can use the optimized weights     w_i = \sum_i {w_ij}    where w_ij = Inv(Cov(A_i, A_j)),  (including geometry factors), and get a better average and more realistic error bar.  You can also check the diagonal vs covariant ratio.

  Another thing to try is to extract the asymmetry from different wires in each plane (2 outside ones,  next 2, etc.), and compare your results.
