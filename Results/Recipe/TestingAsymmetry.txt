
There are things that can be tested for error in asymmetry:

1. Check if it follows counting statistics.

2. The error in asymmetry is expected to be,
delta_A= sigma_d/sqrt(N);
where, N=number of neutrons
       = total beam energy in MWatt Hour for example.
       = per run time X T0 x number of T0 per run x total run time x average beam power per run
       =You can also get this from sns plot.
where sigma_d is just a constant & can be ignored(set to 1) for now.
